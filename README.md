 # Memory Game:

As my first project it came to the conclusion that PacMan wasn't the way to go and so decided with a memory game.
Pretty much your average memory game, fun and exciting, but that's if you really, really enjoy them.
Most people find them boring and a waste of time which is understandable as we live in a day and age where people are busy with FIFA 17, Snap Chat, Facebook and photo shopping on Instagram.
So with the holidays just looming around the corner I decided to make it more light hearted as a holiday themed memory game.  

The memory game starts giving the player exactly two seconds to remember where the four red snowmen are in a twenty-five boxed grid which then will randomise every time player choses to play again. This will happen every time.
it's as simple as that (so it sounds).

What I found to understand more and enjoy building this game was mainly the styling. I felt a lot more confident with my ability.
I also found that I understood more of the javascript which is great for me.  



What I found difficult building in this app was starting the Javascript from scratch and is something I need to work on as much as I can.
