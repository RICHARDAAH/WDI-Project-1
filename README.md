# WDI-Project-1
This is the first project for the WDI course. The timeline was five days.

 # Memory Game:

As this was my very first project first project it came to the conclusion that PacMan wasn't the way to go and settled with a memory game.
Your average memory game, fun and exciting, but that's if you really, really enjoy them.
Most people find them uninteresting, which is understandable as we live in a day and age where people are busy with FIFA 17, Snap Chat, Facebook and photo shopping on Instagram.

So with the holidays just looming around the corner I decided to make it more light hearted as a holiday themed memory game.  

The memory game is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It starts by giving the player exactly two seconds to remember where the four red snowmen are in a twenty-five boxed grid which then will randomise every time player choses to play again. This will happen every time.

The player has just 6 clicks in total to find the targets. If the player succeeds in guessing all of them right a message will appear saying they've won with a button that says 'Play again', same will happen if the user loses.
it's as simple as that (so it sounds).
